# FMCG-demo
This is a demo for FMCG using tkinter.
## Introduction
This project I will focus on dectecting object and classifying each object into distinct categories. Images could contain above 500 objects and each object look very similar or even identical, positioned in close proximity. I have to compare the rules which manufacture give with the arrangements of object in images and make sure they match
